ADMIN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR FAXAS.NET
=====================================

STEP 1: Copy Your Service Account Key
--------------------------------------
1. Copy your Firebase service account key file:
   FROM: C:\Users\MrFax\Documents\faxas-website-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-b5a908dc58.json
   TO: C:\1) FAXAS\CODING PROJECTS\faxas.net\faxas_website\service-account-key.json

   (Just rename it to "service-account-key.json" when you copy it)

STEP 2: Create Your Account
---------------------------
1. Make sure the dev server is running:
   npm run dev

2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/register
3. Sign up with your email

STEP 3: Make Yourself Admin
---------------------------
Option A - Using the script (EASIEST):

1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Run this command (replace with your email):
   
   node scripts/make-admin.js your-email@example.com

Option B - Using Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Find the "users" collection
5. Find your user document
6. Add field: role = "admin"

STEP 4: Verify It Worked
------------------------
1. Sign out from the website
2. Sign back in
3. You should see "Admin" in the navigation
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin

That's it! You're now an admin.

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
If the script doesn't work:
- Make sure the service account key is copied correctly
- Check that you're using the right email
- Try signing out and back in again

If you still can't access admin:
- Go to http://localhost:3000/debug/auth
- This will show you your current auth status

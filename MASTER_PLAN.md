# FAXAS.NET Master Development Plan - UPDATED
## Version-Based Implementation Roadmap with Unified Portal Strategy

### 📋 Executive Summary
This master plan outlines a comprehensive, version-based approach to building FAXAS.NET from its current state to a fully-featured lead generation and client portal system. Each version represents a stable, deployable increment that adds value while maintaining code quality and user experience.

**🚨 STRATEGIC PIVOT (2025-07-28):** We are implementing a unified Portal System that evolves with the user journey - starting as a Lead Portal (advanced contact form) and naturally transforming into a Client Portal upon contract signing. This single-system approach ensures continuity, reduces development complexity, and creates a seamless experience from first contact through project delivery.

## 🏗️ Portal Evolution Architecture

### The Unified Portal Journey
```
Lead Portal (v1.2) → Proposal Portal (v2.0) → Client Portal (v2.1) → Alumni Portal (Future)
```

**Same Account, Growing Capabilities:**
- **Lead**: Account creation, questionnaire, basic dashboard
- **Qualified Lead**: Proposal viewing, contract signing
- **Active Client**: Project management, file sharing, invoicing
- **Alumni**: Portfolio access, testimonials, referrals

This approach ensures users never need to create multiple accounts or learn new systems as their relationship with FAXAS.NET evolves.
